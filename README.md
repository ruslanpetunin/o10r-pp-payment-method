# orchestrator-pp-payment-method

`orchestrator-pp-payment-method` is a TypeScript library that provides a factory function for generating an array of `PaymentMethod` objects. It contains logic of payment methods.

These methods are created based on project settings and initialization data, both of which conform to interfaces from [`orchestrator-pp-core`](https://github.com/ruslanpetunin/orchestrator-pp-core).
